## Narrative

Short narrative or description about the user and why they're using your product/service (try to capture their attitudes, needs, problems/concerns, and experience)

Lena is a college student who lives and breathes music. Whether she’s studying, walking across campus, or getting ready for a night out, there’s always a soundtrack playing. She uses music as a way to express herself and connect with others — discovering a new artist feels like uncovering a hidden gem she wants to share.
While mainstream platforms help her find popular songs, Lena craves a space where she can interact with others who have a unique taste in music, and not just stream in isolation. She’s tired of algorithmic playlists and wants to see what people are actually listening to — and start conversations around it. She’s also open to supporting small artists but doesn't know where to find them in an authentic, non-commercialized way.
