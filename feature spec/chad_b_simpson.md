## Narrative

Short narrative or description about the user and why they're using your product/service (try to capture their attitudes, needs, problems/concerns, and experience)

Chad is a 22 year old college student, and he struggles to find people who likes the same music as him on this depressing campus. There is also a lack of access or information about the type of music events he likes. He’s tired of algorithms recommending the same big-name artists and wants a more human-centered way to discover music, preferably through people who share his intense love for obscure subgenres of music like death metal, darkwave, or math rock. Chad often finds himself combing through listservs, Reddit threads or random Spotify playlists to find something new, but he wishes there was an easier way to meet others who share his vibe and swap recs. For him, music is a way to connect emotionally and socially — he just needs the right platform to make that happen. BUT, he discovered this app.
